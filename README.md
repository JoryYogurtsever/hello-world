# hello-world
### this file will act as my coding blog and a journal of my progress

* *26/03/2018* {dates in DD/MM/YYYY} <br>
    so far basic lessons in python and javascript from codeacademy are completed, today it is time to do this tutorial and set up my github account.

* *11/04/2018*
  1. So far I have finished my course in the foundations of front end development and done two projects using
  HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as jquery and Backbone.
  1. My main goal today was to start understanding how to use github and how to
use it from the command line. I am also trying to format my README files a bit
more nicely.
  1. I have uploaded two projects from my course and will soon begin on the
development of my own website using HTML, CSS and javascript. I need to work a bit
more on Ajax and jquery as I still don't fully understand how to use them properly.

Haven't been terribly dilligent with this journal. It's now *30/08/2018* I've been coding for over half a year
I've learned a lot about javascript and vue.js and learned the proper workflow using webpack, vueCLI, ESLint 
etcetra. Please have a look at some of the projects on this site to get a sense of my abilities or visit joryhagen.com
